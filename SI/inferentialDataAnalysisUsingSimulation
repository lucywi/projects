# Inferential Data Analysis Using Simulation

# Synopsis
The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. This simulation looks at the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponential(0.2)s. 

# Data Processing
Define the variables: 
```{r}
n <- 40
lamda <- 0.2
sim <- 1000
```

The theoretical values:
```{r}
theoreticalMean <- 1/lamda
theoreticalStandardDeviation <- ((1/lamda) * (1/sqrt(n)))
theoreticalVariance <- theoreticalStandardDeviation^2
```

The simulation values:
```{r}
data <- matrix(rexp(n*sim, lamda), sim)
rowMeans <- apply(data, 1, mean)
simulationMean <- mean(rowMeans)
simulationStandardDeviation <- sd(rowMeans)
simulationVariance <- var(rowMeans)
```

# Results
1. Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution.
```{r}
theoreticalMean
simulationMean
```
The theoretical center of the distribution is 5, whereas the simulated center is 4.976017.

2. Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
```{r}
theoreticalStandardDeviation
simulationStandardDeviation
```
The theoretical variance of the distribution is 0.7905694, whereas the simulated variance is 0.7960064.

3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal. Focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
dfrm <- data.frame(rowMeans)
ggplot(dfrm,aes(x=rowMeans)) +  geom_histogram(binwidth = lambda, color="black",aes(y = ..density..)) +  labs(y="Density")  +  stat_function(fun=dnorm,args=list(mean=simulationMean, sd=simulationStandardDeviation),color = "red", size = 2.0)
```
