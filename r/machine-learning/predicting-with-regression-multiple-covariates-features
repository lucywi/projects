# Predicting With Regression Multiple Covariates/Predictors/Features

Load ISLR, ggplot2, and caret libraries. Load wage dataset. Subset logwage data. 
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
data(Wage)
summary(Wage)
```

Build training and test sets. 
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=Wage$wage, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- Wage[inTrain,]
testing <- Wage[-inTrain,]
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```

Plot the training dataset using a feature plot to see all variables plotted against each other. 
```{r}
featurePlot(x=training[,c("age", "education", "jobclass")],
            y=training$wage,
            plot="pairs")
```

Look to see if you can see any relationships to the y variable, which is wage. It looks like there is a relationship to wage and education level. 



Plot age vs. wage with different color by jobclass
```{r}
qplot(age, wage, color=jobclass, data=training)
```

Plot age vs. wage with different color by education
```{r}
qplot(age, wage, color=education, data=training)
```

Fit a linear model
```{r}
modFit <- train(wage ~ age + jobclass + education, 
                method="lm", data=training)
finMod <- modFit$finalModel
modFit
```


DIAGNOSTIC PLOTS 

Plot residuals vs. fitted 
```{r}
plot(finMod, 1, pch=19, cex=0.5, col="#00000010")
```

You want the line centered at 0 because the residuals are the difference between the model prediction and the actual values you're trying to predict. 


Color by variables not used in the model
```{r}
qplot(finMod$fitted, finMod$residuals, color=race, data=training)
```

Plot by index
```{r}
plot(finMod$residuals, pch=19)
```

Looks like a lot of the outliers are in the higher rows. 


Predicted vs. truth in test set
```{r}
pred <- predict(modFit, testing)
qplot(wage, pred, color=year, data=testing)
```
