# Predicting Wages Based on Age, Education, and Job Class

Load ISLR, ggplot2, and caret libraries. Load wage dataset. 
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
data(Wage)
summary(Wage)
```

Build training and test sets. 
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=Wage$wage, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- Wage[inTrain,]
testing <- Wage[-inTrain,]
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```

Plot the training dataset using a feature plot to see all variables plotted against each other. 
```{r}
featurePlot(x=training[,c("age", "education", "jobclass")],
            y=training$wage,
            plot="pairs")
```

Look to see if you can see any relationships to the y variable, which is wage. It looks like there is a relationship to wage and education level. 



Plot the training dataset using a qplot with color.
```{r}
qplot(age, wage, color=jobclass, data=training)
```

From this plot, you can see that the data points closer to 300 with respect to wages, is in the information jobclass, rather than the industrial jobclass. 



Add a regression smoother. Plot age v. wage, but add colors with respect to education. 
```{r}
qq <- qplot(age, wage, color=education, data=training)
qq + geom_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

Break up wages into 3 groups. 
```{r}
library(Hmisc)
cutWage <- cut2(training$wage, g=3)
table(cutWage)
```

Now, use these groups to make a box plot of wage groups vs. age. 
```{r}
p1 <- qplot(cutWage, age, data=training, fill=cutWage,
geom=c("boxplot"))
p1
```

Tables that looks at the wage groups and the jobclass. 
```{r}
t1 <- table(cutWage, training$jobclass)
prop.table(t1,1)
```

Create a density plot. 
```{r}
qplot(wage, color=education, data=training, geom="density")
```
